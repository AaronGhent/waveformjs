Waveform.JS
==========

Waveform.JS makes drawing [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) waveforms simple and
lets you **style** and **color** them the way you want. It comes as a small
JavaScript library and is using a lightweight service hosted on
[waveformjs.org](http://waveformjs.org) that translates the waveform image provided by
SoundCloud into an **array** of **floating points**.

The project is open source and [hosted on Github](http://github.com/soundcloud/waveform.js). This page provides
all the documentation you'll need as well as a list of [examples](#examples).
Waveform.js is available to use under the [MIT software license](#).

You can report bugs and discuss features on the [Github issues page](http://github.com/soundcloud/waveform.js/issues) and send tweets to [@waveformjs](http://twitter.com/waveformjs).
